# Shannon-metrics-on-classical-ciphers

The code in this repository is used to quantify Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion on classical ciphers such as Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and Playfair cipher. The implementation is done in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- sympy

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas sympy
``` 
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Srinathmp/Shannon-metrics-on-classical-ciphers
   ```
2. Reposiotory has three main folders:
   - `data`: Contains CSV files with classical metrics experiment results for each cipher.
   - `mnt/data`: Contains CSV files with classical metrics experiment results for each cipher.
   - `Classical-metrics`: Contains jupyter notebooks to generate experiment results for classical metrics measurement of each classical cipher.
   - `jenson-shannon`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each classical cipher that measure the newly proposed metrics.

3. Navigate to the `Classical-metrics` or `jenson-shannon` folder and open the desired Jupyter notebook to run the experiments.

4. Run the notebook cells to see the results and visualizations.
